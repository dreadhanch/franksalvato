                <h1>Cases of Note</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>United States v. McCauley, 983 F.3d 690 (4th Cir. 2020).</h3> This was a pornography related case tried before Judge Ellis in the Eastern District of Virginia. Despite the serious nature of these allegations, Mr. Salvato was convinced his client was innocent of the charged offense. During trial, Judge Ellis gave the jury incorrect instructions of law. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit unanimously reversed Judge Ellis and the case was remanded back to the Eastern District of Virginia. On remand, the United States did not pursue federal charges. Mr. McCauley’s case was transferred to State Court, and he received probation. This case has altered the landscape of federal prosecutions in this area of the law.</li>
                    <li><h3>United States v. Under Seal, 819 F. 3d 715 (4th Cir. 2016).</h3> The government appealed a decision by the Honorable Judge Lee dismissing a RICO murder charge against Mr. Salvato’s client. A panel of Fourth Circuit judges ruled in favor of the defense and the murder charge remained dismissed. This case has a broad impact on the treatment of offenders charged with these serious offenses.</li>
                    <li><h3>United States v. Duff, 931 F. Supp. 1306 (EDVA, Judge Cacheris).</h3> Mr. Duff was charged with firearms offenses. In a pretrial motions hearing, dispositive issues were presented to the Judge. In a written opinion, the Court noted the case agent had been “effectively impeached” on numerous material matters. The case was dismissed and the United States declined to appeal.</li>
                    <li><h3>United States v. Davis, Record No. 95-5639 (4th Circuit 1996)</h3>After a trial before the legendary Albert v. Bryan, Jr., Mr. Salvato took the case on appeal to the Fourth Circuit challenging Judge Bryan’s decision on various issues including a jury instruction omission. The case was reversed as the Court agreed with Mr. Salvato that the instructions given by Judge Bryan were erroneous. Mr. Davis was not retried and the case was dismissed.</li>
